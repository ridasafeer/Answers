The answers to the three technical questions for the 2021 GDSC Community & Code Technical Assessment can be found within this repo, listed below. Let me know if you have any trouble viewing any of my responses.

--- 

> From Figure 3 in the UniServer questions above, create an API documentation for all endpoints outlined. The document should be written in markdown and formatted neatly.

The response is found in the file titled *Q1- API Documentation* in this branch.

> Start a ZenHub Kanban board. Create 5 issues with 5 sample work prompts written in markdown. Then, create a sprint spanning two weeks including all 5 issues.

This can be found under the ZenHub tab in this repo. The sprint spans 2 weeks and contains 5 issues, 4 of which are organized into two Epics. Two high priority issues were moved into the sprint backlog to be worked on for this specific sprint, and the upcoming sprints will transfer the issues from the product backlog into the sprint backlog as more issues are completed. The issues were given estimations and are already ordered by priority. I assumed that the sprint had not started yet, therefore no issues are in progress or ready for demo. 

>  Using Figma, develop a desktop app user-interface containing any common components. Have fun with the design and color scheme and make it your own. This is an important task as creating Figma designs will be imperative for our workflow in the future. Publish a picture (PNG or JPEG) of your design to the Github repo.

I chose to design a sample dashboard for a note-taking app, similar to apps like Evernote or Notion. A picture of the desktop app design is titled *Q3 - Desktop App UI Design* within this branch.
